# BIOMD0000000072: Model_1

## Installation

Download this repository, and install with distutils

`python setup.py install`

Or, install using pip

`pip install git+https://github.com/biomodels/BIOMD0000000072.git`

To install a specific version (in this example, from the 2014-09-16 BioModels release)

`pip install git+https://github.com/biomodels/BIOMD0000000072.git@20140916`

## Usage

Importing the model package.

`import BIOMD0000000072 as model`

Get the SBML string from the model

`print model.sbmlString`

If [python-libsbml](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-libsbml) bindings are
installed, the libsbml.SBMLDocument object is also accessible

`model.sbml`


# Model Notes


The paper describes both wild-type and mutant cells of G protein cycle by
using different values of G protein deactivation. We chosed the wild-type,
k=0.11 s-1.

The unit of the concentration for the proteins are numbers of molecules per
cell.

Figure5(A) was reproduced with COPASI 4.0 (Build 18) and SBML_odeSolver.
Figure5(B) was reproduced with COPASI 4.0 (Build 18).
